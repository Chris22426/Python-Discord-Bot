# RoBirbPublic
Public branch of RoBirbs code

RoBirb is the main project of mine, which I have spent countless hours on. So here, have the code so you won't need to spend countless hours as well!
It has everything from a currency system (as long as you link a MongoDB database), to an inventory system, to gambling games and moderation features.
I've removed the bot token and database URL (for obvious reasons). Feel free to add your own, and use this framework for your own bot.
I'll try and update this every week or so. The actual repo gets updated many times a day, and I don't have the patience to update both.
